## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

This is my personal 3D portfolio, built as an interactive space rather than a static website. It combines animated 3D scenes, smooth camera transitions, and responsive design to create an experience that reflects how I think and build.

Inside, you’ll find the projects I’ve worked on, the problems I enjoy solving, and the skills I use daily as a Full-Stack developer, all presented in a way that’s meant to be explored, not just scrolled
